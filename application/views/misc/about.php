                <h1>About CGStarter</h1>

                <p>
                    cgStarter is the new portal for Ballistic Publishing products. It is a crowd funded pre-sales site for digital art related products. It will be the exclusive outlet for all Ballistic Publishing books.
                </p>

                <p>
                    cgStarter is also the place to bring your own digital art products to market. Accepted projects get access to the full expertise of the Ballistic Publishing team and global publishing system. This frees artists and editors to concentrate on collecting great content while Ballistic Publishing looks after book (or other format) creation, printing, packaging, global sales and distribution.

                        <h4>Will I be able to get Ballistic books in bookstores after the campaign?</h4>
                        <p>No. Ballistic Publishing will no longer print trade editions to be sold through resellers. You have to purchase products during a campaign or you will miss out. However there will always be bulk lots of product available in the campaign. Once the campaign closes any product available is essentially a collectable and may only be obtainable in very limited quantity, if at all, at a much higher price than originally offered in the campaign.</p>

                        <p>Yes. Expect to see these series continue. Like EXPOSE they will come back in enhanced and expanded product line-ups.</p>
